<li>
<p>Cookies, log files, and pixel-tags (Web beacons) are technologies used by the Purdue Sites to identify a user as the user moves through Purdue Sites, or as the user clicks on a Purdue online advertisement located on a third party website. Your browser allows us to place some information (session based IDs and/or persistent cookies) on your computer’s hard drive that identifies the computer you are using. We may use cookies to personalize our Web sites and to track your usage across other Purdue Sites. Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies.  On occasion, we contract with third parties to place cookies on your computer’s hard drive.   Although cookies do not normally contain personally identifiable information, if you have provided us information about you, we may associate your registration information with cookies or other tracking utilities our Web site places on your computer’s hard drive. Associating a cookie with your registration data allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality. Without cookies, this functionality would not be possible.  Some of our business partners may use cookies on our sites (for example, links to business partners). We do not want our business partners to use cookies to track our customers’ activities once they leave our sites. However, we may not have total control over how our business partners may use cookies on our Web sites.   In addition, we may use other tracking systems like pixel-tags. Pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, are similar in function to a cookie. But because of their insignificant size, it is not visible; though, they are used to pass certain information to our servers to personalize our Web sites and to track your usage across other Purdue Web sites and third party Web sites where Purdue online advertisements are located. In addition, we may also use pixel tags in our HTML based e-mails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a resource to Site visitors, Purdue may provide links to other websites. Site users should carefully review the privacy policies and practices of these websites, as Purdue cannot control or be responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. </p>

<p>For the purpose of determining the effectiveness of our Site and other online marketing programs, Purdue may hire certain third party organizations that collect, analyze and report on non-personally identifiable data or provide Web site and/or program support services. To the extent possible, Purdue will require these organizations to conform to Purdue’s Privacy Policy. </p>

<span class="anchor"><a name="legal" href="#">Back to Top</a></span>

<li>
<p>THIRD PARTIES.  Purdue may share some kinds of information with third parties as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Companies and people who work for us:</b> Purdue contracts with other companies and individuals to help Purdue provide services. For example, Purdue may host some of our Sites on another company’s computers, hire technical consultants to maintain our Web-based health sites, or work with companies to remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, and provide customer service. In addition, if you are a health care professional, Purdue may validate your licensure status and other information against available databases that list licensed health care professionals. In order to perform their jobs, these other companies may have limited access to some of the personal information Purdue maintain about our users. Other companies may collect information on our behalf through their sites. This occasionally incorporates the use of frames on the site that will not show the URL you are visiting in the browser address window. We require such companies to comply with the terms of our privacy policies, to limit their access to any personal information to the minimum necessary to perform their obligations, and not to use the information they may access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us. We use our best efforts to limit other companies use of personally identifiable or health care information. </li>

<span class="anchor"><a name="legal" href="#">Back to Top</a></span><br>

<li><b>Promotional and informational offers:</b> Sometimes Purdue sends offers to selected groups of customers. To accomplish this Purdue may use third parties working on behalf of Purdue. Purdue provides a variety of mechanisms for you to tell us you do not want to receive such promotional – informational offers. For example, Purdue may provide an opt-in box for customers to receive information that is sent by a third-party fulfillment house.  You can elect not to receive promotional or informational material from us by following the instructions to opt-out as mentioned or included in each of our programs that Purdue sends to you. </li>
<li><b>Legal requirements:</b> We may release account and other personal information when Purdue believes that its release is required to comply with the law regulations, rules or local ordinances.
